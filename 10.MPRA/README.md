# Reporter assays for variant allelic function test

Allelic transcriptional activity of CCVs from the 15_5p15.33 locus was assessed as part of MPRA. Briefly, MPRA libraries were generated by cloning 145bp genomic sequence encompassing each test variant with reference or alternative allele in forward and reverse complementary direction in front of the minimal promoter of the luciferase constructs. Each test sequence was associated with 25 unique sequence tags (12bp) at the 3’ untranslated regions of the luciferase gene. MPRA libraries were transfected to two lung cancer cell lines, A549 (lung adenocarcinoma) and H520 (lung squamous cell carcinoma) with or without short-term exposure (10 µM for 18 hr and 42 hr for A549 and H520, respectively) to a tobacco carcinogen, BaP.

A linear regression was performed to assess the effect of allele on the transcript output measured by normalized tag counts across 25 different tags and 5 transfection replicates in each condition using the formula: Ratio = Allele + Strand (forward or reverse) + Transfection batch. To determine the significance of allelic difference, robust sandwich type variance estimate in the Wald test was performed. **(MPRA.R)**
